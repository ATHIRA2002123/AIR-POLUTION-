🌍 Air Pollution Monitoring Using DBSCAN Algorithm 🌱

📚 Overview

           Welcome to the Air Pollution Monitoring Using DBSCAN Algorithm project! This project leverages the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to monitor and predict air quality in various cities.
           
The goal is to analyze pollutant levels, predict air quality trends, and help identify regions where air pollution is particularly severe.

The project uses clustering to categorize areas based on their pollution levels, helping to highlight areas in need of immediate attention.


🚀 Features

      Air Quality Prediction: The project utilizes DBSCAN clustering to predict and categorize air quality levels in cities. Pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and more are used in the clustering process. 🌫️

       Accuracy Calculation: The system calculates the accuracy of predicted pollutant levels against actual values. This allows for evaluating the effectiveness of the model. ✅

      Interactive Interface: The project provides an intuitive, interactive visualization of the data, making it easier to understand trends in pollution levels across cities. 📊

        Real-time Data: The system uses up-to-date city-wise air pollution data to help track and predict trends in air quality. 🌆

      Noise Detection: Using DBSCAN, areas of abnormal data points or outliers are detected, helping in isolating regions with unusual pollution levels. 🚨

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

    The project is implemented using several powerful tools and libraries. Below is the list of key technologies used:

          Programming Language: Python 🐍 — A powerful programming language for data analysis and machine learning.

Libraries:

       scikit-learn (DBSCAN) 🔍: This library is used to apply the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to the data.

       pandas 📈: Used for handling and analyzing the dataset, which includes cleaning, manipulating, and preparing the data for analysis.

       matplotlib 📉: This library is used to create visualizations, such as graphs and plots, to showcase air quality trends and clustering results.

       numpy ➗: Used for efficient numerical operations on large datasets, supporting the clustering and analysis process.

       seaborn 🌈: Used to create aesthetically pleasing and informative data visualizations.
